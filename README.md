# Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Google ADK

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates building **modular, tool-integrated LLM agents** using **Google ADK**. The agents are capable of real-time data retrieval, personalized recommendations, and context-aware multi-turn conversations. It showcases practical applications of **Sequential and Parallel agent workflows**, external tool integration, and session state management.

## Features
- **Modular Agent Design:** Reusable functions to define and control agent behavior.  
- **Tool Integration:** Agents use **Google Search, weather APIs, and Tavily via LangChain** for live, personalized data.  
- **Advanced Workflows:** Sequential and Parallel agent orchestration for complex, multi-step tasks.  
- **Context-Aware Interactions:** Agents maintain session state to remember user preferences and previous queries.  

## Example Use Cases
- Generate **personalized travel itineraries** using live search and event data.  
- Create **dynamic packing lists** tailored to user plans.  
- Handle **multi-turn conversations** with context retention across sessions.  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google ADK  
- LangChain  
- External APIs (Google Search, OpenWeather, Tavily)  

## Key Concepts
- LLM Agents & Multi-Agent Systems  
- Sequential & Parallel Agent Workflows  
- Tool Calling & API Integration  
- Session State Management  
- Context-Aware Conversational AI  

## Outcome
This project highlights the **power of LLM agents combined with external tools** to create intelligent, practical applications that handle complex workflows and maintain user context in real-time.
